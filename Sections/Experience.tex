\job{Advanced Robotics R\&D Internship}{Amazon Robotics}{May 2020 - August 2020}{Boston, MA}{Sections/Logos/AR_Logo.jpg}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyzed robot arm workcell faults and collected data to SQL database to display it to dashboards using Apache Superset. Presented patterns and solutions and collaborated with leadership team in decision making.
        \item Designed and deployed workcell fault diagnosis and mitigation systems, reducing downtime by 60\% (initial tests).
        \item Developed vision system + path planning system for FANUC robots to recover from workcell faults by picking up dropped products.
